        <div id="coaldescrip">The Coal Mine Safety System is a comprehensive safety solution employing Arduino Uno, DHT sensor, vibration sensor, and smoke sensor to ensure the well-being of miners and minimize risks within coal mines. The Arduino Uno acts as the central processing unit, gathering real-time data on temperature, humidity, vibration, and smoke levels. The system constantly compares this data to predefined safety thresholds, triggering visual and audible alerts in case of hazardous conditions. Additionally, the system can communicate wirelessly to central monitoring stations or miners' devices, allowing for swift response and evacuation if needed. This integrated approach provides a proactive means of enhancing safety measures and preventing accidents, fostering a secure environment for coal mining operations.</div>
